# US Expenses in Iran — Real-Time Cost Tracker

This project displays a real-time estimate of U.S. military expenditures during the 2025 airstrikes on Iran, beginning on **June 21, 2025**. The cost counter updates every second based on an approximate per-second burn rate calculated from publicly available defense data and reporting.

## How the Estimate Was Calculated

The displayed total combines both **direct** and **indirect** costs incurred during the initial strikes:

### Direct Costs
- **GBU-57 MOP bombs**: Estimated 6 used, ~$3.5M each.
- **Tomahawk cruise missiles**: Estimated 20 used, ~$2.0M each.
- **Aircraft operation costs**: B-2 bombers ($150K/hour), fighter jets (F-16, ~$27K/hour), and air refueling (KC-135, ~$19K/hour).
- **Flight hours**: Based on public estimates of sortie lengths (~24 hours for B-2 missions).

### Indirect Costs
- Logistics, command and control, intelligence support, satellite surveillance, maintenance, and personnel costs — estimated using average daily spending data from similar U.S. air campaigns (e.g., Iraq/Syria).

## Final Estimate Summary

- **Total Initial Cost (One Day of Strikes):** ≈ $103,000,000
- **Cost Per Second (Over 24 hours):** ≈ $1,192/second
